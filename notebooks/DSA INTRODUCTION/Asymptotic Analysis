Asymptotic Analysis: Big-O Notation and More 

1. The efficiency of an algoithm depends on amount of time, storage and other resources 
    Which is measured using Asymptotic notations.

2. The study of change in performance of the algorithm with the change in the order of the input size is defined as asymptotic analysis.

3. asymptotic notations - mathematical notaitons - describe the running time of an alogithm.

4. there are always best case(minimum time) and worst case (maximum time) and average time.

5. 3 asymptotic notations
    Big-O notations
    Omega notation
    Thetha notation

6. Big-O Notation:
    represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm.
    worst-case complexity of an algorithm.
    Since it gives the worst case running time- it is widely used one

7. Omega Notaion:
    represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm.
    best case complexity of an algorithm.

8. Thetha Notation(0 - notation):
    encloses the fun. from above and below.
    represents both the upper and lower bound of rumning time of an algorithm.
    used for analyzing the average case complexity of an alogirthm.
