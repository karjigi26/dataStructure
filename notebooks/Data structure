Data Structure - 1. Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data
                 2. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
    Types - Linear and Non- Linear

1. Linear DS: 
    The elements are arranged in sequence one after the other
    easy to implement
    if complexity of the program increases, it's not the best choice to use.
    Types:

        1. Array DS:
            same data Type
            arranged in continuous meory location
            can be accessed by using memory index ex. 0,1,2,3....
        
        2. Stack DS:
            stored in LIFO principle. -- Last In First Out
            ex: pile of plates

        3. Queue DS:
            unlike stack, stored in FIFO principle -- First In First Out
            ex: queue of people in the ticket counter.

        4. Linked List DS:
            data elements are connected through a series of nodes and each node contains the data items and address to the next node.
            it will stop once it encounters null
            starting node is termed as head

2. Non Linear DS:
